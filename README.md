Idea bank for educational games about COVID-19, pandemics (endemics, outbreaks, etc), germs (good/bad germs, germ warfare, germophobia), natural disasters (tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, tsunamis), manmade disasters (Ocean Garbage Patches, microplastics, carbon/methane emissions), and more.

***Objective: Build reality-based strategy games for kids to prepare them for when it is their turn to run the World.***

*Quotes from Ender's Game
> Ender Wiggin: Fifty years ago an alien force known as the Formics attacked Earth. Tens of millions died. It was only through the sacrifice of our greatest commander that we avoided total annihilation. We've been preparing for them to come back ever since. The International Fleet decided that the world's smartest children are the planet's best hope. Raised on war games, their decisions are intuitive, decisive, fearless. I am one of those recruits.

## Pandemic Patch - Augmented Reality Game to Identify & Patch COVID-19 Problems

Today, hospitals around the world are experiencing surge issues as the number of patients overwhelms the available beds. Supply and staff shortages are adding to the crisis. Our global health system needs a patch. We propose a gamified approach to hospital congestion that teaches and rewards the players for taking localized actions to help prevent hospital congestion in their locations. 

### 1st Game Goal: Reduce Strain on Hospital Systems
*Hospital Congestion - South Korea method from NY Times article (see below)*<br />
1. intervene before catastrophe<br /> 
2. test frequently and safely<br />
3. contact tracing, isolation, and monitoring<br />
4. public alerts (including info about contact tracing), public help, consistent government messaging 

## Future Game Goals: Educate Individuals & Governments 
1. Global: Lockdown/shutdown, Isolation, & Mental Health<br />
2. Economies: Failed Businesses & Massive Unemployment<br />
3. Governments: Police States & Martial Law<br />
4. Isolation: Families, Couples, Individuals<br />

### Future Game Features:
- Build and run families, governments, towns, cities, counties, states, countries.
- Plan and build infrastructures that are disaster ready.
- Mimic & Augment the real world.
- Apply Science and Technology while being mindful of our natural environment.
- Streamline communications.
- Effective provision of goods and services.
- Runs simulations.
- Include apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic scenarios.
- Solve problems brought about by crimes, disasters, epidemics, pandemics, etc.
- Teaches and encourages practicing how to become good followers and good leaders.
- Rank gamers. Top gamers may be tapped by agencies/governments to help solve issues. Identify the best and the brightest.
- Gamers are intuitive, decisive, fearless.
- Gridcoin, World Community Grid, BOINC compatibility
- Blockchain incentives

### How to achieve objective:
- Tap the best strategy game makers, real world builders, virtual world builders, model countries/governments, model citizens. In other words, tap Humanity.
- Apply lessons learned and lessons to be learned.
- We believe that with the World's current knowledge, skills and technology combined, this can be achieved.<br />
- Build, build, and buidl.<br />

### Potential issues with mass adoption include: 
1. privacy rights - USA medical privacy rights could prevent public alerts as detailed as S. Korea's, though anonymized data could minimize the privacy rights issues<br />
2. costs of tests - USA requires the citizens to pay for tests, S. Korea has national health & special rules for COVID tests<br />
3. will of governments - slow-acting without consistent direction for citizenry vs. immediate action with consistent direction<br />
4. will of citizenry - threat of outbreak must be taken seriously; however, homelessness kills which is why low income workers go to work sick - how to balance?<br />
